# Boris Bikes

Transport for London, the body responsible for delivery of a new bike system, come to to us (makers apprentices) with a plan: a network of docking stations and bikes that anyone can use. They want us (makers apprentices) to build a program that will emulate all the docking stations, bikes, and infrastructure (repair staff, and so on) required to make their dream a reality.

# Motivation 

This project was created as part of the Makers apprenticeship. The motivation behind this project is to learn about Test Driven Development. I will be pair programming with colleagues to complete 22 challenges.
